# Gifts Catcher
Feel exhausted from the finals?  Get tired of the daily work? Can't wait to celebrate Christmas after Thanksgiving?  "Gifts catcher" is a good choice!
You can play the game without anything even thinking. The only thing you need to do is "clone" the folder "My_project" and type 
`./project.py `
in the command line. Then you can use the **left or right arrow key** to control the direction of the "sock" and catch as many "falling gifts" as possible. The initial lives are 3, that means you have THREE chances to miss the "falling gifts".
This game is inspired by the classical catch games developed by the "pygame" module. I included the Christmas elements to make a basic game have more fun. 
Have fun!
